# Discrete-Pearson-Rayleigh-Random-Walk


This repository contains the theoretical work and MatLab code developed in collaboration with Professor Massimo Franceschetti at the University of California, San Diego. The project focuses on the Discrete-Pearson Rayleigh random walk, with a particular emphasis on exploring how the conditional mass function of Poisson-distributed step sizes evolves as the number of steps 
ùëö
and the rate parameter
Œª are varied.
The code generates plots of the conditional mass functions, providing a visual representation of how the distribution changes with different parameters.
Additionally, a comprehensive 30-page PDF document detailing the problem is included as a .pdf file, in which we discuss the theoretical background of the problem.
