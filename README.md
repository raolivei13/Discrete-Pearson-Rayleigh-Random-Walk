# Discrete-Pearson-Rayleigh-Random-Walk


This repository contains the theoretical work and MatLab code developed in collaboration with Professor Massimo Franceschetti at the University of California, San Diego. The project focuses on the Discrete-Pearson Rayleigh random walk, with a particular emphasis on exploring the conditional mass functions of Poisson-distributed step sizes as the number of steps 
𝑚
m and the rate parameter 
𝜆
λ are varied.

Contents:
MatLab Code: This code generates plots of the conditional mass functions, providing a visual representation of how the distribution changes with different parameters.
Documentation: A comprehensive 30-page PDF document detailing the problem, including theoretical background, development process, and key findings.
