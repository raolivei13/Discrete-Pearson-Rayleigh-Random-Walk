# Discrete-Pearson-Rayleigh-Random-Walk


This repository contains the theoretical work and MatLab code developed in collaboration with Professor Massimo Franceschetti at the University of California, San Diego. The project focuses on the Discrete Pearson-Rayleigh random walk, with a particular emphasis on exploring how the conditional mass function of Poisson-distributed step sizes evolves as the number of steps 
𝑚
and the rate parameter
λ are varied.
The code generates plots of the conditional mass functions, providing a visual representation of how the distribution changes with different parameters.
Additionally, a comprehensive 30-page PDF document detailing the problem is included as a .pdf file, in which we discuss the theoretical background of the problem.
